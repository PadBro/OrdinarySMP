          Alt Accounts are allowed but every Minecraft account requires a
          separate Discord account.
          <br />
          Players are limited to ONE alt account each, and this must be
          disclosed in the application form. If it is discovered that a player
          possesses unauthorized and/or more than one alt account, appropriate
          actions will be taken.

        <li>
          Every chunk loader need to be able to be turned off & the locations
          need to be known by staff in form of a text message otherwise your
          farm will get deleted.
        </li>

        <li>
          Players who remain inactive for a month will be automatically removed
          from the Minecraft server. You are welcome to reapply once you're
          ready to play again.
